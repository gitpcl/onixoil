                    <h2>Reservoir</h2>
                    <p>If you have an oil well that is under-performing, we at Onixoil can compile reservoir, completion, and production data from your files in order to make recommendations for procedures on a per well basis. From there, we will get a handle on system permeability, skin and reservoir pressure from pressure transient analysis. We will then model current flow patterns and update your files from future flow rates using our Nodal Analysis modeling program. Onixoil can provide field supervision and engineering support for all types of pressure test/ well test operations.</p>

                    <h2>Well Tests</h2>
                    <p>Tests of all different sorts are a regular part of running a lease pumping operation. Regular testing of a well using different oil and gas well testing procedures is the only way to discover important information, which will be necessary for making decisions about production as well as determining production allocation.</p>
                    <p>Some oil and gas well testing can be quite specialized, but there are a few that you’ll almost certainly have to conduct. Oil well testing is ultimately about the behavior of the reservoir it draws from, so it might be helpful to understand something about how reservoir pressure works.</p>

                    <p>Onixoil for the last decade research state of the art companies to work together to improve drastically environmental impact during Oil & Gas Operations.</p>
                    <h3>Chemical Bioremediation</h3>
                    <p>ONIXOIL enter into a commercial agreement with an ecological company that manufactures and promotes bio-remediation products, maintenance, restoration, cleaning and bio-treatment of oils and hydrocarbons for the industrial sector.</p>
                    <p>Our Team is a multidisciplinary team with specialists in different areas: microbiologists, chemists, chemical engineers, biotechnologists, agricultural engineers and specialists in environmental safety. A productive oil well requires many different resources, each with a specific use. No one understands that better to apply new technologies than ONIXOIL, which is why we have built our company to go beyond fracking sand hauling to provide chemical treatment services and logistics.</p>
                    <p>Our team is well versed in federal and state regulations, and we will work with clients to provide the resources and services you need.</p>
                    <h3>Oil Slops, Flow back and Liquid Waste Treatment</h3>
                    <p>The treatment of liquid oil waste from drilling, production and cleaning operations is often challenging. Whether the waste is oil slops, flow back, well washing or pit washings, the nature of the waste with solids, oil and water makes it hard separate.</p>
                    <p>The Onixoil products allow these liquid waste to be treated faster and more effectively compared to traditional chemistry. By injecting or adding the right chemistry to the waste it is possible to split the waste into oil, water, and solids.</p>
                    <p>This means oil is recovered and there is value in that of course. The water is re-used in drilling, exploration, production or disposed of in an injection well. The solids are the only waste part and can often go to the landfill without further stabilizing required.</p>
                    <p>Out of 100bbl of flowback or slops waste, we often see only 10 - 20bbl of waste. The remainder is quality oil and water. Oilfield waste is of course never the same twice. However, our products are robust and work over a substantial cross-section of oil waste streams. This reduces the number of possible options and keeps stocks and in-field usage simple and straightforward.</p>
                    <p>If you work with oil slops waste, flowback or mud washings, give us a call or drop us an email and we will arrange a brief 10 - 15-minute call to understand your waste, your process, and your results.</p>
                    <h3>The Project</h3>
                    <p>An operator in Nigeria needed to increase oil production from a horizontal well drilled in a heavy and viscous, low pressure, oil reservoir. The well was drilled in 2015 and oil production had steadily declined to a low value of 283 bbl/d, and total production (oil and water) declined to 552 bbl/d.</p>
                    <p>The operator was looking for a solution to increase the oil well production and productivity index. Onixoil provided our microemulsion Onixoil Breaker chemistry to completely restore the near-wellbore to its original permeability and increase production.</p>
                    <h4>The Solution</h4>
                    <p>The Onixoil Breaker was deployed with coil tubing across the reservoir section and allowed to soak for the desired period. It restored the near-wellbore permeability to its original virgin state by completely removing the damage caused by the drilling mud when the well was drilled, completely removing all the downhole in-situ emulsion that formed during production, and water-wetting all sand grains.</p>
                    <p>After the soak period, the well was opened and Onixoil Breaker had successfully remediated the horizontal well, removing near-wellbore formation damage and increasing production by 259%, from 283 bbl/d to 1,016 bbl/d. After the well flowed for one month, the operator turned on a gas lift valve and the oil production further ramped up to 1,620 bbl/d.</p>
                    <h4>The Results</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased well production from 283 bbl/d to 1,016 bbl/d on the same choke size. This represents a 259% increase (or 3.59 times the pretreatment rate.</li>
                        <li>Total production increased from 552 bbl/d to 1,722 bbl/d.</li>
                        <li>Productivity index increased, enabling a single gas lift value to increase oil production to 1,620 bbl/d</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Defer Asset Replacement and Plant Shutdowns: Easier, Safer, Faster</h3>
                    <p>Ovolifts' unique and patented technology allows access to multiple work areas whilst the equipment is in-service, giving plant engineers and contractors critical information on pipe condition and access to perform maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Why is this so valuable? Because it enables a plant to advance their pipe and cable rack maintenance programs from reactive to planned footings.</p>
                    <p>Reactive maintenance pushes aside planned maintenance and often results in emergency work outside of plant turnarounds. It is also costlier because emergency repairs are difficult to diagnose, budget and execute, whereas planned maintenance tasks are less work intensive.</p>
                    <p>The solution enables operators to address corrosion problems before they become critical by enabling the maintenance of pipe infrastructure within engineered stress curves whilst the lines are in-service.</p>
                    
                    <h4>REACTIVE VS PLANNED MAINTENANCE</h4>
                    <h5>OVERVIEW OF OUR TOOLS</h5>
                    <p>We have three purpose-built tools designed for three unique lifting scenarios, the common denominator across the tools is the use of the same lifting arrangement which is patent protected.</p>
                    <p>Our Mega-Pipe Lifter is the only system in the market capable of lifting very large pipes resting on ground-level supports. To execute this lift otherwise would require a crane at a substantially higher cost. It is also capable in its minimum configuration of lifting 40 tons of multiple pipes on a rack from one pipe support, and a higher tonnage if additional jacks are added to the lifting pipe.</p>
                    <p>The Multi-Pipe Lifter is a lighter, more versatile and easier to handle device for lifting an entire pipe rack or selected pipes from a support.</p> 
                    <p>The Uni-Pipe Lifter is used to lift individual pipes and is exceptionally light and quick to install. </p>
                    <p>Extend the service life of your pipe infrastructure safely and cost-effectively</p>
